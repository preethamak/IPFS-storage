This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

# Storage App

## Overview
The Storage App is a decentralized application designed to facilitate the upload of files and the storage of their corresponding IPFS hashes on the blockchain. This project utilizes modern web technologies including React, Next.js, and Framer Motion to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features
- Upload files directly to the application.
- Store the IPFS hash of uploaded files on the blockchain.
- User-friendly interface with smooth animations.
- Built with a focus on performance and scalability.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating animations in React applications.
- **IPFS**: A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system.
- **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd storage-app
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the application in development mode, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, you can access the application in your browser.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
